# emailSearch
The goal of this project was to have an alternative way to make a google search through a simple email. While the program is running, you would be able send an email with your question in the subject line to pleasesearchthis@gmail.com and it would automatically respond with the google results from the query. 
For example, if I had the question "What is the population of Ireland", I could put that in the subject of an email to the address and it would return something formatted like this, <img width="818" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-04 at 9 34 27 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75557870/148152213-ba5ad0b4-9e08-4e67-bdf4-307c4a245473.png">
